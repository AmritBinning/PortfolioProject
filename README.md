# COVID-19 Infections and Vaccinations Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries and analysis related to COVID-19 infections and vaccinations. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from real-world data, focusing on various aspects of COVID-19 spread and its impact on different regions.

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations data. The primary objectives were to understand the spread of infections, the impact on populations, the likelihood of deaths, and the progress of vaccination efforts across different locations and continents.

# SQL Queries and Insights

## Selecting Data

I began by selecting relevant data fields such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population from the CovidDeaths table.

## Contracted COVID Percentage

I calculated the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19 for specific locations, focusing on the United Kingdom as an example.

## Population Infection Rate

I calculated the percentage of the population that got infected with COVID-19 for all locations, allowing a comparison of infection rates across different regions.

## Highest Infection Rates

I identified countries with the highest infection rates in relation to their populations, highlighting regions most affected by COVID-19.

## Countries with Highest Death Count

I identified countries with the highest death counts in relation to their populations, shedding light on regions most severely impacted by fatalities.

## Continent-wise Death Counts

I analysed the death counts per continent to understand the varying impact of COVID-19 on different parts of the world.

## Global COVID Impact

I calculated the global impact of COVID-19 by summing up total cases and deaths, along with the percentage of deaths in relation to total cases.

## Vaccination Progress

I joined the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables to analyze the progress of vaccinations in relation to COVID-19 infections.

## Conclusion

This repository showcases the SQL queries and analysis conducted on COVID-19 infections and vaccinations data. The insights gained provide a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact on different locations and the progress of vaccination efforts.
